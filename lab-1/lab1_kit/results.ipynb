Conflict misses occur when two blocks are mapped to the same cache line: since they can't both occupy the same line, one of them will be evicted.

    "There are two main policies to deal with writes in memory hierarchies. With write-through, we opt to write information both in cache and the main memory whenever there's a write, so that the information is always matching. With write-back, we opt to write information only in cache, writing to the main memory only when the cache line is evicted. The latter is generally more efficient, as accessing the main memory is very time consuming, but it is considerably more complex to implement. Furthermore, both schemes can make use of a write buffer, which acts as a queue of writes to be performed in the main memory, allowing the processor to continue its execution immediately (unless the buffer is already full, in which case it must stall) and therefore mitigate write or block replacement (for write-through and write-back, respectively) penalties."
